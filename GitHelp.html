        //upstream branch
        When you want to checkout a branch in git from a remote repository such as GitHub or Bitbucket, 
        the “Upstream Branch” is the remote branch hosted on Github or Bitbucket.
        It's the branch you fetch/pull from whenever you issue a plain git fetch/git pull basically without arguments.



Create repositories
A new repository can either be created locally, or an existing repository can be cloned. When a repository was initialized locally, you have to push it to GitHub afterwards.

$ git init

The git init command turns an existing directory into a new Git repository inside the folder you are running this command. After using the git init command, link the local repository to an empty GitHub repository using the following command:

$ git remote add origin [url]

Specifies the remote repository for your local repository. The url points to a repository on GitHub.

$ git clone [url]

Clone (download) a repository that already exists on GitHub, including all of the files, branches, and commits
